                </ul>
                <h3>DETAILED MERCURY FACTS</h3>
                <p>One solar day (the time from noon to noon on the planet’s surface) on Mercury lasts the equivalent of 176
                    Earth days while the sidereal day (the time for 1 rotation in relation to a fixed point) lasts 59 Earth
                    days. Mercury is nearly tidally locked to the Sun and over time this has slowed the rotation of the planet
                    to almost match its orbit around the Sun. Mercury also has the highest orbital eccentricity of all the
                    planets with its distance from the Sun ranging from 46 to 70 million km.
                </p>
                <p>One of five planets visible with the naked eye a, Mercury is just 4,879 Kilometres across its equator, compared
                    with 12,742 Kilometres for the Earth.
                </p>
                <p>Even though the planet is small, Mercury is very dense. Each cubic centimetre has a density of 5.4 grams,
                    with only the Earth having a higher density. This is largely due to Mercury being composed mainly of
                    heavy metals and rock.</p>
                <p>As the iron core of the planet cooled and contracted, the surface of the planet became wrinkled. Scientist
                    have named these wrinkles, Lobate Scarps. These Scarps can be up to a mile high and hundreds of miles
                    long.

                    <li>Venus does not have any moons or rings.</li>
                    <li>Venus is nearly as big as the Earth with a diameter of 12,104 km.</li>
                    <li>Venus is thought to be made up of a central iron core, rocky mantle and silicate crust.</li>
                    <li>A day on the surface of Venus (solar day) would appear to take 117 Earth days.</li>

                <h3>DETAILED VENUS FACTS</h3>
                <p>It takes 243 Earth days to rotate once on its axis (sidereal day). The planet’s orbit around the Sun takes
                    225 Earth days, compared to the Earth’s 365. A day on the surface of Venus (solar day) takes 117 Earth
                    days.
                </p>
                <p>This means that Venus is rotating in the opposite direction to the Sun, this is also know as a retrograde
                    rotation. A possible reason might be a collision in the past with an asteroid or other object that caused
                    the planet to alter its rotational path. It also differs from most other planets in our solar system
                    by having no natural satellites.
                </p>
                <p>Only the Moon is brighter. With a magnitude of between -3.8 to -4.6 Venus is so bright it can be seen during
                    daytime on a clear day.</p>
                <p>The Earth and Venus are very similar in size with only a 638 km difference in diameter, Venus having 81.5%
                    of the Earth’s mass. Both also have a central core, a molten mantle and a crust.

                <p>This deceleration is happening almost imperceptibly, at approximately 17 milliseconds per hundred years,
                    although the rate at which it occurs is not perfectly uniform. This has the effect of lengthening our
                    days, but it happens so slowly that it could be as much as 140 million years before the length of a day
                    will have increased to 25 hours.
                </p>
                <p>Due to the apparent movements of the Sun and planets in relation to their viewpoint, ancient scientists insisted
                    that the Earth remained static, whilst other celestial bodies travelled in circular orbits around it.
                    Eventually, the view that the Sun was at the centre of the universe was postulated by Copernicus, though
                    this is also not the case.
                </p>
                <p>This phenomenon is caused by the nickel-iron core of the planet, coupled with its rapid rotation. This field
                    protects the Earth from the effects of solar wind.</p>
                <p>As a percentage of the size of the body it orbits, the Moon is the largest satellite of any planet in our

                <p>Even though Mars has only 15% of the Earth’s volume and just over 10% of the Earth’s mass, around two thirds
                    of the Earth’s surface is covered in water. Martian surface gravity is only 37% of the Earth’s (meaning
                    you could leap nearly three times higher on Mars).

                <h3>DETAILED JUPITER FACTS</h3>
                <p>This was around the 7th or 8th century BC. Jupiter is named after the king of the Roman gods. To the Greeks,
                    it represented Zeus, the god of thunder. The Mesopotamians saw Jupiter as the god Marduk and patron of
                    the city of Babylon. Germanic tribes saw this planet as Donar, or Thor.
                </p>
                <p>It turns on its axis once every 9 hours and 55 minutes. The rapid rotation flattens the planet slightly,
                    giving it an oblate shape.
                </p>
                <p>From our point of view on Earth, it appears to move slowly in the sky, taking months to move from one constellation
                    to another.
                </p>
                <p>The upper atmosphere of Jupiter is divided into cloud belts and zones. They are made primarily of ammonia
                    crystals, sulfur, and mixtures of the two compounds.

                    <li>Saturn’s upper atmosphere is divided into bands of clouds.</li>

                <h3>DETAILED SATURN FACTS</h3>
                <p>It exists in layers that get denser farther into the planet. Eventually, deep inside, the hydrogen becomes
                    metallic. At the core lies a hot interior.
                </p>
                <p>The Saturnian rings are made mostly of chunks of ice and small amounts of carbonaceous dust. The rings stretch
                    out more than 120,700 km from the planet, but are are amazingly thin: only about 20 meters thick.
                </p>
                <p>It is composed mostly of water ice and rock. Its frozen surface has lakes of liquid methane and landscapes
                    covered with frozen nitrogen. Planetary scientists consider Titan to be a possible harbour for life,
                    but not Earth-like life.
                </p>
                <p>Pioneer 11, Voyager 1 and 2, and the Cassini-Huygens mission have all studied the planet. Cassini orbited
                    Saturn from July 2004 until September 2017, sending back a wealth of data about the planet, its moons,
                    and rings.
